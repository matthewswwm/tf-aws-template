### cloud-init troubleshooting

* Cloud-init executes scripts in alphabetical order
    * For simplicity, label the created scripts with numbers according to execution order
    * Take note that this is related to how cloud-init works specifically and even the content type can also affect the execution order
* Note that you need sudo permissions
* Find the logs in `var/log`, specifically `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
* Find the scripts in `/var/lib/cloud/instance/scripts`
